                            Dear Sales Team,
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                           I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that the scheduled execution date for an order with Sales Order number <p t-out="object.order_id.name or ''"></p> has been postponed. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we need to adjust the execution plan.
                        <br/>
                        If you have any questions or concerns regarding this delay or need any further information, please don't hesitate to reach out to the concerned team.
                        <br/>
                        Your cooperation and understanding during this adjustment are highly appreciated. Let's work together to ensure the success of the sale order execution.
                        <br/>
                        Thank you for your continued support.
                    </p>
